Pillow-like inclusions of fine-grained hornblende-augite-biotite melatonalite contain ~30% biotite and grade to finer-grained quartz diorite, diorite, or gabbro lacking biotite.  The biotite-free phase appears to have been chilled against the granodiorite, whereas the biotite-rich phase displays sharp to gradational (commingled) contacts with granodiorite, indicating that the granodiorite was not completely crystallized when the more mafic melt was emplaced.  The biotite-rich melatonalite phase may be a hybrid formed by mixing of the biotite-free phase and the granodiorite.

The granodiorite locally contains K-feldspar megacrysts up to 35 mm long, and may correlate with unit Ygp.  In thin section, it can be seen that aggregates of fine-grained quartz and feldspar have replaced crystals with medium-grained outlines.  Relics of medium-grained K-feldspar (orthoclase) display Carlsbad twinning.

A thin section of the biotite-rich melatonalite contains approximately 30% biotite, 15-20% clinopyroxene (augite), 1-2% amphibole (hornblende?), 25-30% plagioclase, 20-25% quartz, and trace apatite.  Quartz is polycrystalline and formed in part as replacement of plagioclase.  Some of the biotite has replaced embayed pyroxene and amphibole.

In the Driscoll Mountain area, metasandstone units range from a few cm to 20 m thick.  They consist mainly of resistant, fine-grained, quartzofeldspathic psammite and semipelitic schist, along with some micaceous quartzite and pelitic schist.  These rocks are composed of quartz, feldspar, and muscovite in various proportions.  Some intervals contain chlorite or biotite (in part replaced by chlorite) as well.  The resistant rocks of this assemblage typically form layers a few cm thick, with thin partings of pelitic quartz-muscovite schist.  Thick intervals of psammite and semipelite contain interlayers of pelitic schist (or locally phyllite) several cm thick.

The psammite-semipelite units form ledges that are interfoliated with thick units of less-resistant, fine- to medium-grained, pelitic to semipelitic quartz-muscovite and quartz-feldspar-muscovite schist.

Leucogranite dikes and stringers locally are interfoliated with the metasedimentary rocks of the Pinal schist.

The rock is composed of hornblende, fine-grained plagioclase, and locally biotite.  Hornblende typically is fine- to medium-grained and forms aggregates 5-10 mm long, although crystals up to 1 x 12 cm are locally present in dikes.  The mafic-mineral content is typically 60% or more, and some dikes range to hornblendite in composition (with >90% hornblende).  Thin sections from Paige Creek east of Driscoll Mountain contain 45-60% hornblende, 0-10% biotite, 30-40% plagioclase, 3-5% opaque minerals (ilmenite?), and trace apatite.

Near contacts with metasedimentary tectonites, including marble and Pinal schist, meladiorite typically is well-foliated and commonly grades toward the contact to fine-grained plagioclase-hornblende-biotite schist.  In one locality along Paige Creek east of Driscoll Mountain, meladiorite with chilled intrusive margins is exposed in intrusive contact with Pinal schist and interfoliated fine-grained granitoid tectonites.  Near the eastern edge of the Happy Valley 7.5' Quadrangle, meladiorite intrudes Paleozoic carbonate tectonites and so are younger than Paleozoic.  Tectonite deformation has affected rocks of this unit before middle Tertiary tectonic exhumation and cooling.  The meladiorite therefore was likely emplaced during middle Jurassic arc-related magmatism (~180-160 Ma), during late Jurassic basaltic magmatism related to extension in the Bisbee trough (160-150 Ma), or during regional Laramide magmatism (~75-55 Ma).",0006.0004,Standard,"138;035;168",,6BCD18BD-1F1B-4D13-9B5B-DBE2A68BEC36,,
