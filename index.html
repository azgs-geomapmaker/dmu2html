                    <span>Qy2 deposits consist of piedmont terrace deposits located primarily along the flanks of incised drainages, broad low-relief distal fan deposits onlapping onto Holocene river alluvium, and infrequently active tributary drainage deposits. These deposits consist of predominantly fine grained unconsolidated to weakly consolidated sediments although isolated sub-rounded to sub-angular cobbles and boulders may be present at the surface in small quantities. Where inset into older alluvium, Qy2 deposits are planar with remnant bar and swale microtopography. Distal fan Qy2 deposits are broad and sandy with numerous small braided channel systems. Rarely active Qy2 tributary drainages are generally of limited extent, relatively steep, and more densely vegetated than Qy3 tributary drainages. Soil development on Qy2 deposits is minor, characterized by incipient stage I calcium carbonate accumulation in the form of small filaments and medium brown (10 YR) surface coloration. Vegetation on Qy2 surfaces ranges from numerous small mesquite trees and grasses in distal fan environments to medium creosote, acacia, and cholla in tributaries and inset terraces. These surfaces are subject to inundation during moderate to extreme flow conditions when channel flow exceeds capacity or due to channel migration on low-relief portions of broad distal fan deposits. Planar Qy2 terraces are typically elevated from 30 cm to 1.5 m above active channels.</span>

Qi2 deposits are overall planar but can exhibit mild to moderate rounding near incised channels or inset terraces.

Boulders up to 3m consist largely of banded gneiss, foliated leucogranite, and heterogeneous pegmatitic leucogranite.  Near the Martinez Ranch fault, the nature of outcrop (bedrock vs. megablock conglomerate) is difficult to determine because blocks are large and surrounded by soil and vegetation.  Random vs. aligned nature of foliation and gneissic layering were used to determine bedrock vs. conglomerate  nature of outcrop.  Blocks appear to be as large as 20 m.  Location of contact between bedrock and megablock conglomerate is not well determined.</span>

Conglomerate is crudely bedded to massive, locally well bedded where sandy.  Bedding is generally defined by variations in clast size, with sandy layers locally defining bedding.  Poorly sorted nature of conglomerate generally precludes identification of bedforms.  Clasts generally range from 1 to 50cm, and rarely exceed 1m.  Clast composition is highly variable and commonly reflects nearby or underlying bedrock.  Abundant subrounded clasts of speckled equigranular granite in Happy Valley are inferred to have been derived from nearby granite that forms upper plate of San Pedro detachment fault.  Mylonitic and pegmatitic leucogranite that form the footwall of the San Pedro detachment fault in the Happy Valley area are not represented in clast compositions, presumably because, at the time of conglomerate deposition, the footwall of the detachment fault in the Rincon Mountains had not been tectonically exhumed.  </span>

Glauconitic siltstone and sandstone are present in some intervals, notably near the base of the formation.  Cross-bedding and cross-lamination are locally common.  Some carbonate and calcareous sandstone units are medium-bedded.  Intraclast conglomerate beds up to 15 cm thick, containing flat pebbles of laminated quartzose sandstone in limestone matrix, are conspicuous in some intervals, especially in the middle of the section.

The base of the Abrigo Formation is placed at the first upward appearance of calcareous strata.  South of Eagle Peak this transition is marked by a ~1m thick, medium red, fine-grained calcareous sandstone.  North of Eagle Peak, the lower Abrigo includes beds of dark-purple-weathered, hematite-stained, glauconitic siltstone.  The contact with overlying Martin Formation is an unconformity that is commonly cryptic, occurring in an apparent transition upward from dominantly sandstone and calcareous sandstone to dominantly sandy and silty carbonate.  North and south of Eagle Peak, the top of the Abrigo Formation is marked by a 1-2 m thick bed of medium-grained quartz sandstone with cross-bedding accentuated by recessive laminations.  Where stratigraphic context is uncertain, Abrigo Formation can be distinguished from sandstone of the Bisbee Group by the relative lack of magnetite and very high quartz content in the Abrigo Formation.</span>

As estimated in the field, the composition ranges from quartz arenite to subarkosic or sublithic arenite, with minor arkose in the lower part of the section.  Most beds are medium-grained and moderately sorted, with subrounded to subangular grains.  Fine-grained intervals appear more mature, moderately to possibly well-sorted, with subrounded grains.  Some beds contain dispersed coarse-sand and granule-sized grains of quartz and subordinate jasper and are poorly sorted.  Planar lamination is common throughout the unit; low-angle and trough cross-bedding are common in some intervals.  Amalgamated, tabular, medium bedsets weather to form slabs and blocky ledges.  Color ranges from white to tan to dark brown.  Black, magnetite(?)-rich laminations are present locally, especially at lower stratigraphic levels.  Near the western edge of the Happy Valley, the top 3-4 m of the Bolsa Quartzite is somewhat massive, resistant to erosion, and pale gray to pale whitish tan.

                    <span>Meladiorite forms an intrusion, exposed in a 4-km2 area between Driscoll Mountain and Bear Creek, and several peripheral dikes and small intrusions.  The rock is composed of hornblende, fine-grained plagioclase, and locally biotite.  Hornblende typically is fine- to medium-grained and forms aggregates 5-10 mm long, although crystals up to 1 x 12 cm are locally present in dikes.  The mafic-mineral content is typically 60% or more, and some dikes range to hornblendite in composition (with >90% hornblende).  Thin sections from Paige Creek east of Driscoll Mountain contain 45-60% hornblende, 0-10% biotite, 30-40% plagioclase, 3-5% opaque minerals (ilmenite?), and trace apatite.

Near contacts with metasedimentary tectonites, including marble and Pinal schist, meladiorite typically is well-foliated and commonly grades toward the contact to fine-grained plagioclase-hornblende-biotite schist.  In one locality along Paige Creek east of Driscoll Mountain, meladiorite with chilled intrusive margins is exposed in intrusive contact with Pinal schist and interfoliated fine-grained granitoid tectonites.  Near the eastern edge of the Happy Valley 7.5' Quadrangle, meladiorite intrudes Paleozoic carbonate tectonites and so are younger than Paleozoic.  Tectonite deformation has affected rocks of this unit before middle Tertiary tectonic exhumation and cooling.  The meladiorite therefore was likely emplaced during middle Jurassic arc-related magmatism (~180-160 Ma), during late Jurassic basaltic magmatism related to extension in the Bisbee trough (160-150 Ma), or during regional Laramide magmatism (~75-55 Ma).</span>

                    <span>Fine- to medium-grained, recrystallized granodiorite, containing 10-25% fine-grained biotite in 5-10-mm aggregates that define a prominent foliation.  Pillow-like inclusions of fine-grained hornblende-augite-biotite melatonalite contain ~30% biotite and grade to finer-grained quartz diorite, diorite, or gabbro lacking biotite.  The biotite-free phase appears to have been chilled against the granodiorite, whereas the biotite-rich phase displays sharp to gradational (commingled) contacts with granodiorite, indicating that the granodiorite was not completely crystallized when the more mafic melt was emplaced.  The biotite-rich melatonalite phase may be a hybrid formed by mixing of the biotite-free phase and the granodiorite.

The granodiorite locally contains K-feldspar megacrysts up to 35 mm long, and may correlate with unit Ygp.  In thin section, it can be seen that aggregates of fine-grained quartz and feldspar have replaced crystals with medium-grained outlines.  Relics of medium-grained K-feldspar (orthoclase) display Carlsbad twinning.

A thin section of the biotite-rich melatonalite contains approximately 30% biotite, 15-20% clinopyroxene (augite), 1-2% amphibole (hornblende?), 25-30% plagioclase, 20-25% quartz, and trace apatite.  Quartz is polycrystalline and formed in part as replacement of plagioclase.  Some of the biotite has replaced embayed pyroxene and amphibole.

This unit apparently forms enclaves or screens in muscovite leucogranite of map unit Ygl, but intrusive relationships have been obscured by foliation of both units.</span>

K-feldspar in such zones is commonly in the 5-10 mm size range, rarely up to 25 x 5 mm.  Muscovite is very fine-grained even where feldspar is coarse-grained.  The rock locally contains traces to a few percent biotite, also very fine-grained. In eastern exposures along Redrock Creek this unit contains as much as 10% biotite.

In the Driscoll Mountain area, metasandstone units range from a few cm to 20 m thick.  They consist mainly of resistant, fine-grained, quartzofeldspathic psammite and semipelitic schist, along with some micaceous quartzite and pelitic schist.  These rocks are composed of quartz, feldspar, and muscovite in various proportions.  Some intervals contain chlorite or biotite (in part replaced by chlorite) as well.  The resistant rocks of this assemblage typically form layers a few cm thick, with thin partings of pelitic quartz-muscovite schist.  Thick intervals of psammite and semipelite contain interlayers of pelitic schist (or locally phyllite) several cm thick.

The psammite-semipelite units form ledges that are interfoliated with thick units of less-resistant, fine- to medium-grained, pelitic to semipelitic quartz-muscovite and quartz-feldspar-muscovite schist.

Leucogranite dikes and stringers locally are interfoliated with the metasedimentary rocks of the Pinal schist.  They grade to fine-grained muscovite-quartz-feldspar or biotite-quartz-feldspar schist, becoming difficult to distinguish from semipelite and psammite with increased metamorphic differentiation and transposition.</span>

The carbonate tectonite contains inclusions of heterogeneous pegmatitic myscovite leucogranite that could be tectonically incorporated or intruded.</span>

The unit locally contains conglomerate beds and pelitic schist.  Several conglomerate beds, 0.5 to 3 m thick, contain quartzite clasts that are flattened parallel to compositional layering and that rarely exceed 15 cm in longest direction.  Locally includes fine-grained micaceous quartzite, some of which could have been derived from the Mesoproterozoic Pioneer Shale of the Apache Group.  Where this quartzite is derived from Dripping Spring Quartzite, it locally contains lenses and stringers derived from Mesoproterozoic Sierra Ancha diabase.  South of Driscoll Mountain, fine-grained quartzite interfoliated with marble tectonites may have been derived from Permian Scherrer Formation.</span>

Thin layers of epidote calc-silicate and discontinuous units of dark-gray, fine-grained, quartz-biotite-feldspar schist are also present.  Some quartzofeldspathic layers interfoliated with the schist and psammite appear to have been derived from a leucogranitic protolith.  The semipelite and psammite contain quartz, feldspar, and muscovite, plus locally chlorite or biotite.  Abundant chlorite and epidote veinlets locally give the rock a green color.  This unit is interpreted as having been derived from Pinal schist interfoliated with tectonites of calcareous Paleozoic protoliths (e.g., Escabrosa, Horquilla, and Earp formations).</span>
